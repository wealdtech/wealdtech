#Traces

This package provides a way for store and recall contextualised activities.

##Structure of a trace

A trace contains a timestamp, a number of contexts, and an activity.

Searching for traces requires a time range at a minimum.  Additional information supplied about the activity or the context will help narrow down the results.
